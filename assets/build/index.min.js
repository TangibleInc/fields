    //     rather than h23 (00:00 - 23:59). Same can happen with hour12: true in French, which Chrome resolves to h11 (00:00 - 11:59)
    //     rather than h12 (12:00 - 11:59).
    //   - WebKit returns an incorrect hourCycle resolved option in the French locale due to incorrect parsing of 'h' literal
    //     in the resolved pattern. It also formats incorrectly when specifying the hourCycle option for the same reason. [3]

    // A style is an object that, in the simple case, maps CSS property
    // names to strings holding their values, as in `{color: "red",
    // fontWeight: "bold"}`. The property names can be given in
    // camel-case—the library will insert a dash before capital letters
    // when converting them to CSS.
    //
    // If you include an underscore in a property name, it and everything
    // after it will be removed from the output, which can be useful when
    // providing a property multiple times, for browser compatibility
    // reasons.
    //
    // A property in a style object can also be a sub-selector, which
    // extends the current context to add a pseudo-selector or a child
    // selector. Such a property should contain a `&` character, which
    // will be replaced by the current selector. For example `{"&:before":
    // {content: '"hi"'}}`. Sub-selectors and regular properties can
    // freely be mixed in a given object. Any property containing a `&` is
    // assumed to be a sub-selector.
    //
    // Finally, a property can specify an @-block to be wrapped around the
    // styles defined inside the object that's the property's value. For
    // example to create a media query you can do `{"@media screen and
    // (min-width: 400px)": {...}}`.
